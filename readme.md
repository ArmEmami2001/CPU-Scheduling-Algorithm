# 🧮 CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This project is an implementation of **six CPU scheduling algorithms** —  
three **preemptive** and three **non-preemptive** types — written in Python.

---

## ⚡ Preemptive Algorithms
1. **Round Robin (RR)**  
2. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**  
3. **Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)**

---

## 🕰️ Non-Preemptive Algorithms
1. **First Come First Served (FCFS)**  
2. **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**  
3. **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**

---

Each algorithm calculates:
- Start time  
- Completion time  
- Turnaround time  
- Waiting time  
- Average turnaround and waiting times  

---

This project demonstrates how different CPU scheduling strategies affect process order, efficiency, and fairness.
